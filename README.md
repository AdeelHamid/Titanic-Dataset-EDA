# Titanic-Dataset-EDA
We have done this EDA on titanic dataset to get insight of the data.
We were having different question to which we were to answer. like:
How many passenger were travelling and what was their gender and how may are survived and how many are dead with respect to their gender, class and fare.

What we performed:
1. Cleaned the data.
2. 1. Duplicates are removed
   2. null values are removed
   3. outlier are handled
3. analyse the data
4. 1. we used different graph to show the data
   2. some graph are made using plotly and because of load dont uploaded but the codes are upload with comments

In Future:
we can perform EDA for large dataset to get insight and to form decision making
We can prepare the data for machine learning models.
